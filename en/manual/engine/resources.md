# Resources

<div class="doc-incomplete"/>

Resources are images, texture ([```.dds```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface) files and entity images used in your game. Resources are stored in the **Resources** folder of a game application.

>**Note:** As a best practice, all data resources should be placed inside the **Resources** folder to enable easy movement of your project. If resources are placed outside the project, moving the project breaks the links and compiler issues can occur.
