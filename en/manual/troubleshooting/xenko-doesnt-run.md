# Xenko doesn't run

If you're having trouble running Xenko, make sure you've installed all the prerequisites:

* .NET Framework 4.6.2 — download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345)
* Visual C++ Redistributable and Build Tools for Visual Studio — download from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (under **Other Tools and Frameworks**)
    
Alternatively, uninstall Xenko, restart the Xenko installer, and install the prerequisites when prompted.

>[!Note]
> Windows uses the Visual Studio installer to install the Visual C++ Redistributable and Build Tools for Visual Studio prerequisites, but it doesn't install Visual Studio.
