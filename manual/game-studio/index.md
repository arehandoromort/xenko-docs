# Game Studio

Game Studio is the Xenko editor.

In Game Studio, you can:

* import assets, modify their parameters and see changes in real time in the preview window
* organize assets by folder, attach tags and get notifications from modified assets on the disk
* build a game executable and run it directly from Game Studio

For game developers, Game Studio is also integrated with your Visual Studio projects, so you can seamlessly sync and switch back and forth.

## Interface

For more information about the Game Studio interface, see the [Game Studio getting started page](../get-started/game-studio.md).

## Assets

You can create and browse assets in the asset view:
