**Scenes** are the levels in your game. A scene is composed of **entities**, the objects in your project.

The screenshot below shows a scene with a knight, a light, a background, and a camera entity:

When you create a new scene, Game Studio populates it with basic entities such as a light, a camera, and a skybox.
